This is a beginner-friendly Restaurant Reservation project built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. I created this project to understand how backend systems work in a real-world scenario and how to integrate them with a frontend interface.It also includes basic backend features like API routing, data storage with MongoDB, and error handling for common issues. This project helped me gain practical experience in building full-stack web applications.
